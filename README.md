Capstone Project - README

Overview

This project involves the classification of chest X-ray images to detect various lung diseases. The work utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built from scratch, finely-tuned, pre-trained models, and ensemble techniques to achieve high accuracy in classification.
